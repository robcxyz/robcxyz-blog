release
====

Damn it has been years since I have been working on tackle box but it is finally ready to be released.  I have worked on this thing almost every weekend for the last two years as I knew there were some patterns at play that simply made sense. When my last girlfriend broke up with me, tackle box was distinctly one of those reasons. I'm ok with it though as tackle box came out better than I could have ever imagined, despite me thinking that at one point I was going to marry that girl.

One thing that I still don't have a grasp of is what type of language it is. Is it a programming language? I honestly don't know but it has many of the characteristics. Anyways, this is something to write another blog about. What did I actually build? Fuck knows, shit is dope.
