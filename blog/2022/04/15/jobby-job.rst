Jobby jobs
==========

So last month I got let go from my prior employer along with my whole team. While it was a little bit of a jarring event, all my employees are within a month settled in good jobs and I am personally taking care of my prior contracts through my own business. Those engagements were relying on me and while my team vaporized, I am taking on the load doing all the dev / ops work to support the deploying multiple k8s clusters in a new cloud provider dealing with 2 environments, 2 regions, 10 / 5 services x2 across 4 networks. Been spending the last two weeks staring at grafana trying to de-bottleneck this new stack that I have now got my throughput to the point that I can index the ICON blockchain through kafka in a reasonable amount of time. This amounts to about 2k k8s manifests which I am all code generating with tackle.  Interviewing new employees in India and planning on moving out there to be close to a team that I am lining up with a long term contract to support. Pretty hectic working non-stop. Literally waking up every morning, getting to desk, working till I go to sleep, weeks on end. This is basically what I have been doing for years but this is on turbo. Tackle is about to be released and it is all happening at once.
